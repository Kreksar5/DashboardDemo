12-1-17 @ 12:46pm Final changes made to convert deployment code into a demo version that can be added to my programming portfolio. All code has been steralized and should be clean of any important or propriatary information from my time at PSL. All aspects of the code are now pointing to either publicly hosted demo sites or local files containing steralized copies of the expected data. Some minor changes were made to the code to accomodate differences in the formatting of the external data now comming from public domains.
